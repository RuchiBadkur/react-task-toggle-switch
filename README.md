🧠 Step 1: Understand and Repeat the Task
You:
"Okay, so from what I understand, the goal here is to create a toggle switch using React. When the user clicks a button, the background color and text should change accordingly. For example, if it’s ON, clicking it should turn it OFF with a light theme, and vice versa with a dark theme. I’ll be using state to manage the toggle and conditional class styling to handle the background and text color."

🛠️ Step 2: Explain While Coding
Now you begin coding and explain each part:

Code:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useState } from 'react';
You say:
"I’m importing the useState hook from React because I need to maintain the toggle state – whether the switch is on or off."

Code:

jsx
Copy
Edit
const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);
You say:
"I’m initializing a state variable isOn which is initially false. This will represent the OFF state. I’ll toggle this value whenever the button is clicked."

Code:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className={isOn ? "off" : "on"}>
You say:
"Here, I’m applying a dynamic class name to the div. If isOn is true, I’ll use the off class (which shows light background), otherwise on (which shows dark background). This helps me switch themes easily using CSS."

Code:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<button onClick={() => setIsOn(isOn => !isOn)}>
  {isOn ? "OFF" : "ON"}
</button>
You say:
"This button toggles the state using an arrow function that flips the current value of isOn. Also, I’m dynamically changing the button text – if it's currently ON, the button shows OFF, and vice versa."

Code:

css
Copy
Edit
.on {
  background-color: rgb(22, 21, 21);
  color: white;
}

.off {
  background-color: rgb(231, 221, 221);
  color: rgb(16, 16, 16);
}
You say:
"These are the two CSS classes I’m using to change the UI theme based on the state. .on is a dark theme and .off is a light theme."

🎯 Final Wrap-up (Very Important in Interviews)
You say:
"So overall, this is a simple toggle switch using React state and conditional class rendering. It demonstrates how React re-renders the UI based on state changes and how we can use dynamic class names to apply different styles. It also shows clean separation of logic and styling."

Bonus Tip (if there's time):
You can mention improvements:

“If needed, I can also extract the toggle into a separate component.”

“Or, I can persist the theme in localStorage so it remembers the user's choice.”
